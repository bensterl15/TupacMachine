2.1 Photography and holography:

Mathematically intensity I(x,y) is proportional to the complex amplitude squred: I(x,y) prop |psi(x,y)|^2. 

t(x,y) is the amplitude transmittance: to broadcast a proper t(x,y) we can make it proportional to the recorded intesntiy, or:
t(x,y) = |psi(x,y)|^2	-	As a result of this recording, all information about relative phase (depth) is lost

Holography invented by Gabor in 1948 to record both amplitude and phase.

Referring to figure 2.1:

This setup is used to record a point (inside of the pinhole aperture). 

It uses:
A collimated laser as a light source
BS1 to split the beam
M2 along with the pinhole aperture to record the point
M1 to pass along reference light
BS2 to combine the reference light WITH the recorded light
The recording medium to project the object

To describe the pinhole mathematically: we say
psi0(x,y,z0) = delta(x,y) convolved with h(x,y,z0) where h(x,y,z0) is the inverse Fourier Transform of THE Spatial Frequency Transfer Function of propagation.

Specifically: exp(-jk0z0)*(jk0/2piz0) * exp[-jk0(x^2 + y^2)/2z0]

Assuming psi0 is a plane wave, we can expand t(x,y) = |psi_r + psi_o|^2 (psi_r is a plane wave and psi_o is h(x,y,z0)). We simplify and get:
t(x,y) = A + Bsin(k0(x^2 + y^2)/2z0)

If we take the local frequency of t(x,y) we get:
k0x/2piz0 (taking a derivative of the quantity inside the sin): This is like a chirp along the x axis!

To reconstruct the hologram, we hit the transmittance with a simple plane wave (psiR), and then convolve that with the spatial frequency transfer function of propagation.

Made a math mistake on page 31 (twice!)

FZP = Fresnel Zone Plate

To analyze the behaviour of a two-hole plate, we convolve with the plate function of: d(x,y) + d(x - x1,y - y2) and get similar results as the single hole experiment

Section 2.3: Three-dimensional holographic imaging

We see a diagram of 2 different points being recorded into a single hole: Each has different depth and x-y positions and therefore gets convolved differently. And thus:

t(x,y) = |psi1 + psi2 + psiR|^2	And the book picks out t_reli(x,y) the relevant transmittances needed for reconstruction (the book does a poor job at explaining the other relevant terms are complex conjugates of each other)

The reconstructions due to the relevant terms in total is:

psi_pr(x,y)*t_reli(x,y), and we can calculate each virtual distance from the real distance with this formula.

2.3.1:
We define magnifications in this section by taking the ratio of the physical distances and virtual distances: these can be defined in both the latitudal and lonigtudal directions.

2.3.2
One factor present in the latitude magnifiication is (b/l2 - a/l1)*(zr2 - zr1) where a is the x distance of the source point from the pinhole, and b is the distance of the reconstruction point, li is the z distance from the aperture and point i. a should be chosen correctly to prevent Translational distortion.

2.3.3

Chromatic Distortion can occur if the reconstruction wavelength is different than the wavelength of the incoming light (Table 2.1 displays some of the affects).

2.4.1

We define the interferogram between two waves A and B as:
I = <|A + B|^2>		where 	<.> = integral(-T/2,T/2){.}/T lim T -> infinity

Then we investigate the temporal coherence between waves in this section.

v is defined the same way as reflection (Imax - Imin)/(Imax + Imin) but with interferences instead of impedances. v simplifies to:

v = 2A0B0*|gamma(tau)|/(A0^2 + B0^2), where gamma is the time average of the product of phases!

If A and B are out of phase, gamma is zero and if they are completely in phase gamma is one.

Skipping 2.4.2 and 2.4.3

2.4.4:

If we multiply the incoming wave by e^jwt, the interference pattern turns into the Fourier Transform
