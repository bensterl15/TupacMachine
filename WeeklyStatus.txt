Week of 9/23/18:

Ben:
Read chapters 1 and 2 and summarized chapter 2 of the Poon book. We have now read and understand enough of the Fourier Optics to make something to display out of the SLM.
Also tried to find the equipment for the SLM, but only found the optical table. Looked up the complete list of necessary parts and a few of the associated costs (the polarizer in particular is $156.06)
