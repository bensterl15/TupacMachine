Week of 9/23/18:

Ben:
Read chapters 1 and 2 and summarized chapter 2 of the Poon book. We have now read and understand enough of the Fourier Optics to make something to display out of the SLM.
Also tried to find the equipment for the SLM, but only found the optical table. Looked up the complete list of necessary parts and a few of the associated costs (the polarizer in particular is $156.06)
 
Week of 9/30/18

Ben:
Talked to Dino and found the lenses/lasers in his lab; we still need to find the correct room to shoot them in and get something out of the SLM. Also summarized chapter 3 of Poon's book: some of the key points included the effects of changing the angle of reference light (this was equivalent to the comm theory concept of frequency shifting)
