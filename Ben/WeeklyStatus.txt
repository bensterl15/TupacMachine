Week of 9/23/18:

Read chapters 1 and 2 and summarized chapter 2 of the Poon book. We have now read and understand enough of the Fourier Optics to make something to display out of the SLM.
Also tried to find the equipment for the SLM, but only found the optical table. Looked up the complete list of necessary parts and a few of the associated costs (the polarizer in particular is $156.06)
 
Week of 9/30/18

-Talked to Dino and found the lenses/lasers in his lab; we still need to find the correct room to shoot them in and get something out of the SLM. 
-Summarized chapter 3 of Poon's book: some of the key points included the effects of changing the angle of reference light (this was equivalent to the comm theory concept of frequency shifting)
-Implemented one of the scripts in this section and get good results

Week of 10/8/18

-Read chapter 4 for myself and implemented a Matlab script DiffractionFieldRectAperture.m to see the effects of Fresnel diffraction through a square aperture

Week of 10/15/18

-Tried several experimental setups according to the Poon book on the Optical Board (bounced a light off the SLM and observed a spherical diffraction pattern).
-Purchased a wireless HDMI device (from Tinkersphere), plugged it into the SLM, and a special light turns on indicating video signal is received.
-Figured out how to setup the device and broadcast the output of Ellie's matlab script to it.
-Most importantly: To get anything useful out of the SLM, we really need 1.) Spatial Filter 2.) Colimiting Lense 3.) Polarizer 4.) Analyzer.. We need to buy these or
find these in the lab with Yecko's help ASAP

Week of 10/22/18

-Prepared and presented the PowerPoint presentation on our progress

Week of 10/29/18

-Got in contact with Prof Yecko, but he did not have time to help us look through our parts. He will sometime this week.
-Found the correct WPF project with Jun's help and started customizing the UI (this will work as our project)

Week of 11/5/18

-Met with Professor Yecko and figured out that we could order the parts we needed off EBay very cheaply. We prepared an inventory and got it all ordered on EBay.

Week of 11/12/18

-Prepared the poster for the poster session and presented. Got very important feedback from Prof Fontaine about beamwidths and power loss!
-Figured out how to run python scripts internally from our WPF application: The remainder of the problem now is converting Ellie and Jason's Matlab scripts to Python

Week of 11/19/18

-Thanksgiving Break

Week of 11/26/18

-Worked on the theory/intro sections of the final Latex report

Week of 12/3/18

-Finished up the bulk of the Latex Report/Decoded some of the very-hard to understand explanations.

Week of 12/10/18

-Prepared the presentation and finished up the final paper

Week of 1/14/18

-Started putting pieces together on the Optical Table and noticed two problems: Our laser is not powerful enough and we need our parts at precise heights. We started talking to Prof. Yecko and made an appt to get Wolf's advice.

Week of 1/21/18

-While my group members talk to Wolf, I completed the 3D model of the holder in OnShape just in case.

Week of 1/28/18

-Added the finishing touches to the 3D model and sent it to Makerspace to get printed.

Week of 2/4/18

-School flooded. I got good advice from 3D printing people and revised my model to be hexagonal. Printed two complete sets over the weekend.
