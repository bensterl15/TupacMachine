Activity Log Spring Semester (2019)
DongKyu Kim
ECE395

Week (1/16~1/22)
We discussed what we need to get done this semester.

Week (1/23~1/29)
We asked Professor Yecko to ask about the laser specifications and whether we can borrow the high powered green laser.
Professor Yecko suggested that we contact Professor Wolf to see what he has.

Week (1/30~2/5)
Flood

Week (2/6~2/12)
We started the hardware setup to test whether the SLM works, and we started to think about alternatives for the holders.

Week (2/13~2/19)
We went to the hardware shop to buy screws, and did basic setup in the 601 lab.

Week (2/20~2/26)
We set up the system, and we got the SLM to output the default screen.
We have aligned all the necessary components, and we checked the functionality of the SLM by sending in sample images into the machine and visually checked the correct output.
Our next step would be developing a tool to make the depth information available for the viewers to create the 3D modeling.

Week (2/26~3/5)
We worked on the poster. I went to a trip for student visit day, so I didn't contribute that much.
However, we found a paper on creating 3D-like images through image processing, which we will look into and try to implement and improve to be used on our system.
