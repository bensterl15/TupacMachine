Activity Log Spring Semester (2019)
DongKyu Kim
ECE395

Week (1/16~1/22)
We discussed what we need to get done this semester.

Week (1/23~1/29)
We asked Professor Yecko to ask about the laser specifications and whether we can borrow the high powered green laser.
Professor Yecko suggested that we contact Professor Wolf to see what he has.

Week (1/30~2/5)
Flood

Week (2/6~2/12)
We started the hardware setup to test whether the SLM works, and we started to think about alternatives for the holders.

Week (2/13~2/19)
We went to the hardware shop to buy screws, and did basic setup in the 601 lab.

Week (2/20~2/26)
We set up the system, and we got the SLM to output the default screen.
We have aligned all the necessary components, and we checked the functionality of the SLM by sending in sample images into the machine and visually checked the correct output.
Our next step would be developing a tool to make the depth information available for the viewers to create the 3D modeling.

Week (2/26~3/5)
We worked on the poster. I went to a trip for student visit day, so I didn't contribute that much.
However, we found a paper on creating 3D-like images through image processing, which we will look into and try to implement and improve to be used on our system.

Week (3/6~3/12)
Spring Break

Week (3/13~3/19)
Ben wrote the stereoscopic pair algorithm in octave.
We converted this code into Python so that it can be incorporated into our system.

Week (3/20~3/26)
I was at the Duke campus visit, so I didn't contribute much to the porject this week.

Week (3/27~4/2)
I started working on researching different ways of embedding the depth information using a single SLM.
I considered projecting laser beams into a thick medium such as water or fog, but after researching, it seems like our project requires femtosecond lasers which are beyond our budget, or a multiple SLMs or moving display which are all unobtainable at this point.
We decided to stick to the stereoscopic version of our project.
We also did the 50 words summary activity.

Week (4/3~4/9)
We prepared to do the senior project demo critique.
A good example of the holography was prepared, and the demo was done.

Week (4/10~4/16)
We worked on the report.

Week (4/17~4/23)
I was occupied with my master's thesis, so I didn't do anything this week for the senior lab.

Week (4/24~5/3)
We worked on writing the final report, and we prepared for the final presentation.
